########################### GARBAGE TYPES

object_R4_UnsortedTrash							 Unsorted Trash (-> Trash Bin)
tooltip_R4_UnsortedTrash						 \nUnsorted Trash goes to a Trash Bin which turns it into one big stack of Unsorted Garbage.\nThe Unsorted Garbage then goes to the Recycling room.\n\n-- [ ADVISED SETUP FOR THE AVERAGE PRISON ] --\n1 Trash Bin per Kitchen\n  (10, 20, 30 bags: small, medium, or large kitchen)\n1 Trash Bin in Recycling\n  (10-50 bags: depending on prison size)\n1 Trash Bin (10 bags) in areas like Garden & Cemetery\n1 Trash Compactor in Recycling room or Garbage area\n2 Recycling Desks in the Recycling room\n2 Recycle tables in Recycling room\n1 Recycle Bin per Garden or Greenhouse\n\nThis should be more than plenty to deal with the garbage in prisons up to 500 inmates. If you place more Trash Bins, then the garbage will be split over more objects, so it will take longer for each Trash Bin to fill up and get recycled. Trash Bins work like a buffer for your Recycling room.\n\nPlace as many default Bins from the game if you wish.\nThey are just eye-candy now and never collect Unsorted Trash.\n\nGarbage area only needs to hold the Trash Compactor and some walking space for idle Janitors.\nNo other garbage is stored there, so it can be a small room.

object_R4_UnsortedGarbage						 Unsorted Garbage (-> Recycle Desk)
tooltip_R4_UnsortedGarbage						 Unsorted Garbage goes to a Recycle Desk in the Recycling room to be sorted out.

object_R4_SortedGarbage							 Sorted Garbage (-> Trash Compactor)

tooltip_R4_SortedGarbageExport					 All the smelly bits of useless trash, sells for $1.

object_R4_GreenGarbage							 Green Garbage (-> Recycle Bin)
