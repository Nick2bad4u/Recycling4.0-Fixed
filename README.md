<p>One man&#39;s trash is another man&#39;s treasure - provided you can find it in amongst all your rubbish. This Recycling mod will let your prisoners dig through the filthy garbage to sort out valuable bits and pieces from it.</p>
<p>Sorted Garbage goes straight to Exports and Green Garbage will be put in a Recycle Bin to end up as Super Compost for a Garden where your prisoners make food for the Kitchen and flowers for export.</p>
<p>This is an improved version of [url=<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501285297]Recycling">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501285297]Recycling</a> 3.0[/url].</p>

<p>[h1]RECYCLING ROOM[/h1]</p>
<p>Prisoners and staff operating the Recycle Desk will find a lot of stuff:[list][<em>]rotten food gets collected in Green Garbage bags and goes to the Recycle Bins in a Garden or Greenhouse,[</em>]not rotten enough? Then the cabbage goes back to the Kitchen,[<em>]reusable pieces of SheetMetal: back to Workshop,[</em>]pieces of Log and Wood (also -&gt; Workshop),[<em>]thrown away but still usable Library Books with pages missing and other pages sticking together, but who cares, so back to the Library with it,[</em>]bent LicensePlates (who threw those away? they are worth money! just bend them back),[<em>]smelly Dirty Prisoner Uniforms (somebody thought the washing machine is broken, but it ain&#39;t),[</em>]used Food Trays with stinking pieces of rotten food still on them (fire the lazy cook who threw it away instead of washed it clean),[<em>]ingredients (that cabbage should still be eatable),[</em>]used Shop goods (oh yes, why not resell that filthy stained porn magazine),[*]and Crumpled Prisoner Uniforms which will just need another ironing job before they can be worn again by a new inmate.[/list]</p>
<p>[h1]And the circle of recycling shall be round![/h1]</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, did anybody mention the Contraband Heaven your prisoners are working in? Since anything could be thrown away, from rusty old needles to almost empty lighters, the rubbish turns quite valuable for those you don&#39;t want it to be. So you&#39;d better put metal detectors and post some guard dogs around the Recycling room, or some volatile inmate might recycle a broken knife in one of your guards!</p>
<p>This mod includes a heavily modified version of the Garden mod from Elfylia. This garden will produce Cabbage and Potatoes for the Kitchen besides Cucumber, Lilies, Roses, Apples and Cherries for Exports. Having Elfylia&#39;s old mod active at the same time is NOT recommended.</p>
<p>[h1]ADVISED SET UP:[/h1][list][<em>]1 TrashBin (10 bags) in a small Kitchen (or 20 in medium, 30 in large kitchen)[</em>]1 TrashBin in Recycling (10, 20 or 30 bags, depending on prison size)[<em>]1 TrashBin (10 bags) in any area where garbage is produced, like a Garden or Cemetery[</em>]1 Trash Compactor in either Recycling or Garbage area[<em>]2 Recycling Desks in the Recycling room[</em>]2 Recycle Tables in Recycling room[*]1 Recycle Bin per Garden or Greenhouse[/list]</p>
<p>This should be more than plenty to deal with the garbage in prisons up to 500 inmates.
If you place more TrashBins, then the garbage will be split over more objects, so it will take longer for each TrashBin to fill up and get recycled. TrashBins work like a buffer for your Recycling room.</p>
<p>Place as many default Bins from the game if you wish.
They are just eye-candy now and never collect Unsorted Trash.</p>
<p>Garbage area only needs to hold the Trash Compactor and some walking space for idle Janitors.
No other garbage is stored there, so it can be a small room.</p>
<p>[h1]IMPROVEMENTS OVER RECYCLING 3.0[/h1][list][<em>]Unsorted Trash scans for doors and repositions.[</em>]Rotatable Recycle Desk.[<em>]Better RecycleDesk script now throws stuff neatly on stacks to prevent workmen swarming allover the place.[</em>]Recycle Desk now also finds half rotten but still eatable Cabbage going back to Kitchen.[<em>]Added Recycling Worker.[</em>]Added Super Compost: reduces grow times and increases production x2.[<em>]Improved Garden Control script.[</em>]No more lag spikes during Garden Pot jobs spamming.[<em>]Garden Control now has buttons for Weather events and Light.[</em>]Ripe Garden Pots now spawn stacks of exportable stuff instead of single items.[<em>]New Quickbuilds.
