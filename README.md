One man's trash is another man's treasure - provided you can find it in amongst all your rubbish. This Recycling mod will let your prisoners dig through the filthy garbage to sort out valuable bits and pieces from it.

Sorted Garbage goes straight to Exports and Green Garbage will be put in a Recycle Bin to end up as Super Compost for a Garden where your prisoners make food for the Kitchen and flowers for export.

This is an improved version of [Recycling 3.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501285297).

## USAGE
1. Build a Garden (outdoor) or a GreenHouse (indoor). Pick a Quickbuild if you're lazy.
2. Build a small Recycling Room with a few Recycle Desks.
3. Put some Trash Bins around your prison to replace standard Bins.
4. Put a Trash Compactor at the Garbage room.
5. Hire some staff members for your new rooms.
6. Start reform programs to learn prisoners how to work in the new rooms.

That's it!

## NEW ROOMS
- **Garden**: Produces Cucumber, Tomato, Lily, Rose, Apple & Cherry for Exports, and Ingredients, Potatoes, Bacon and Eggs.
- **Greenhouse**: Produces Cucumber, Tomato, Lily, Rose, Ingredients & Potatoes.
- **Recycling**: Recycles the garbage in your prison and sorts out reusable stuff.

## NEW OBJECTS
- **Garden Control**: Place it in the centre of your garden or greenhouse. Set the Harvest Hour and range (3-29 square tiles) with its buttons. You can also connect a DoorTimer to specify several harvest hours per day.
- **Garden Pot**: Place it around the Garden Control. Will need Compost, DDT and Fertilizer which gets spawned at the Garden Control or produced by Recycle Bins.
- **Shed**: Produces Eggs and Bacon at specified times of the day. Set the Harvest Hour with its buttons. You can also connect a DoorTimer to specify several harvest hours per day.
- **Cherry and Apple Tree**: Will blossom and grow fruit for exports.
- **Recycle Desk**: Sorts out usable stuff from garbage. Use its buttons to determine what it will spawn. Set spawn rate to specify after how many garbage bags it will spawn one of the selected items.
- **Recycle Bin**: Collects Green Garbage from the Recycle Desk and turns it into Super Compost for the Garden.
- **TrashBin**: Replaces normal Bins in your prison to collect Unsorted Trash. When filled, the trash goes to Recycling. DO NOT place too many TrashBins, follow the guideline mentioned below!
- **TrashCompactor**: Stores up to 100 bags of sorted garbage and creates 1 stack of garbage to export. Place 1 at Garbage area or Recycling.

## NEW REFORM PROGRAMS
- **Basic Garbage Recycling**: Learn prisoners how to sort out filthy stinking garbage bags.
- **Plant Cultivation**: Learn prisoners to tend/harvest garden plants. A Garden Worker will guide them through this Outdoor reform in a Garden.
- **Botany**: Learn prisoners to tend/harvest garden plants. A Greenhouse Worker will guide them through this Indoor reform in a Greenhouse.

Prisoners qualified for either Plant Cultivation or Botany will be able to work in both rooms, so it doesn't matter if you prefer indoor or outdoor reform programs.

## NEW STAFF
- **Garden Worker**: Does reform and jobs at the Garden.
- **Greenhouse Worker**: Does reform and jobs at the Greenhouse.
- **Recycling Worker**: Does reform and jobs at the Recycling room.

## NEW JOBS
- Plant, Harvest, Tend, Water, Fertilize, Prune, Give DDT, Remove Plants. Most of these jobs are issued between 8am and 22pm, and some can continue through the night.

## NEW GRANTS
- **Garden**: Create a Garden.
- **Garden Production**: Harvest various products.
- **Recycling**: Create a Recycling room.

## RECYCLING ROOM
Prisoners and staff operating the Recycle Desk will find a lot of stuff:
- Rotten food gets collected in Green Garbage bags and goes to the Recycle Bins in a Garden or Greenhouse.
- Not rotten enough? Then the cabbage goes back to the Kitchen.
- Reusable pieces of SheetMetal: back to Workshop.
- Pieces of Log and Wood (also -> Workshop).
- Thrown away but still usable Library Books with pages missing and other pages sticking together, but who cares, so back to the Library with it.
- Bent LicensePlates (who threw those away? they are worth money! just bend them back).
- Smelly Dirty Prisoner Uniforms (somebody thought the washing machine is broken, but it ain't).
- Used Food Trays with stinking pieces of rotten food still on them (fire the lazy cook who threw it away instead of washed it clean).
- Ingredients (that cabbage should still be eatable).
- Used Shop goods (oh yes, why not resell that filthy stained porn magazine).
- Crumpled Prisoner Uniforms which will just need another ironing job before they can be worn again by a new inmate.

And the circle of recycling shall be round!

Oh, and by the way, did anybody mention the Contraband Heaven your prisoners are working in? Since anything could be thrown away, from rusty old needles to almost empty lighters, the rubbish turns quite valuable for those you don't want it to be. So you'd better put metal detectors and post some guard dogs around the Recycling room, or some volatile inmate might recycle a broken knife in one of your guards!

This mod includes a heavily modified version of the Garden mod from Elfylia. This garden will produce Cabbage and Potatoes for the Kitchen besides Cucumber, Lilies, Roses, Apples and Cherries for Exports. Having Elfylia's old mod active at the same time is NOT recommended.

## ADVISED SET UP:
- 1 TrashBin (10 bags) in a small Kitchen (or 20 in medium, 30 in large kitchen)
- 1 TrashBin in Recycling (10, 20 or 30 bags, depending on prison size)
- 1 TrashBin (10 bags) in any area where garbage is produced, like a Garden or Cemetery
- 1 Trash Compactor in either Recycling or Garbage area
- 2 Recycling Desks in the Recycling room
- 2 Recycle Tables in Recycling room
- 1 Recycle Bin per Garden or Greenhouse

This should be more than plenty to deal with the garbage in prisons up to 500 inmates. If you place more TrashBins, then the garbage will be split over more objects, so it will take longer for each TrashBin to fill up and get recycled. TrashBins work like a buffer for your Recycling room.

Place as many default Bins from the game if you wish. They are just eye-candy now and never collect Unsorted Trash.

Garbage area only needs to hold the Trash Compactor and some walking space for idle Janitors. No other garbage is stored there, so it can be a small room.

## IMPROVEMENTS OVER RECYCLING 3.0

- Rotatable Recycle Desk.
- Better RecycleDesk script now throws stuff neatly on stacks to prevent workmen swarming all over the place.

- Improved Garden Control script.
- No more lag spikes during Garden Pot jobs spamming.
